    [ This file partially contains outdated information ]

I just got so tired of being limited to printf("\a"); when I wanted a terminal
beep.  This program isn't supposed to be anything stupendous, it's just
supposed to get the job done.  Its intended purpose in life is to live inside
shell/perl scripts, and allow a little more granularity than you get with the
default terminal bell.  Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this is useful. :)

If for any reason you decide you need to, contact me:

A note about ioctl
------------------

    [ Section removed for suggesting making `beep` suid root. A new
      section on `beep` and permissions will be added soon --
      without any setuid or sudo priviledge escalation risks. ]


Playing Songs
-------------

A surprising number of people have sent in requests, or even patches, to help
beep play multiple, different sounds off a single invocation.  I had always
thought that if people wanted a more complex melody, they would just do 
something like:

$ cat << EOF > song.sh
#!/bin/sh
beep <first beep's options>
beep <second beep's options>
etc...
EOF

Nevertheless, because of repeated and vociferous demand, version 1.2 (and 
presumably all later versions) include the -n/--new switch which allows you to
use one command line to create multiple beeps.  Check the man page for 
details.  I have also had a couple people suggest that I encourage the 
development of such shell scripts/command lines, even collect the particularly
melodious ones.  Certainly if anyone feels like sending some to me, I will put
them somewhere visible, or even include them as a sample.  I think Dvorak's New
World Symphony, 4th Movement, for example, would make a lovely shell script.
I also wouldn't mind a rendition of BNL's If I had a million dollars.  But by
all means, be creative.
